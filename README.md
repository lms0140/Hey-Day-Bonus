# Hey-Day-Bonus
*At Auburn University we celebrate Hey Day!* 
- The history behind this celebration is back in 1947, some students served in World War II and upon returnal they felt like they did not belong there or anywhere any more, so the Government body of Auburn to help them was to hand out name tags so we all could say hey to them so everyone felt like they belonged. We have kept this traditon by handing name tags out to all student to make sure everyone felt welcomed and that they belonged here.
